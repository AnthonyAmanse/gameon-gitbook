The Player service is responsible for authenticating and registering players, and identifying those players to other
services within Game On!

== Environment Variables

The typical method of controlling runtime configuration of Docker-based services is through specification of environment variables.  Either set through a startup script reading from https://coreos.com/etcd/docs/latest/[etcd], from https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#env-environment-variables[command-line] settings, or from our https://github.com/gameontext/gameon/blob/master/docker-compose.yml[docker-compose] example, environment variables allow customization of a specific deployment of Game On!

The player service utilizes the following environment variables:

 * *CONCIERGE_URL*: The full URL to the concierge microservice (e.g. `https://game-on.org/concierge`). 
 * *SUCCESS_CALLBACK*: The full URL to redirect users to after successful OAuth2 authentication with one of the social networking sites (e.g. `https://game-on.org/#/login/callback/`).
 * *PLAYER_URL*: The full URL to the player microservice (e.g. `https://game-on.org/play/players`).
 * *CONCIERGE_KEY*: A secret key, shared between player service and concierge that authenticates player to query concierge about room information.
 * *MONGO_HOST*: IP Address or Hostname of a mongoDB host that player service can use to persist its information about players who have logged in to Game On!
 * *MONGO_PORT*: Same as above, only this is the port number that mongoDB listens on.
 * *TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY*: Application ID/key for consuming OAuth2 authentication for twitter. See link:https://apps.twitter.com/[Twitter's Developer Pages] for more information.
 * *TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET*: Secret from Twitter for utilizing the above ID to authenticate users in Game On!
