*Written In/Based On*: IBM WebSphere Liberty

The Room service is both an implementation of two Game On! rooms in Java, and a template/starting point for implementing
your own room in Java.  The Room service provides an example of how to register with the concierge and how to provide the
WebSocket implementation that the web application expects. 

== Environment Variables

The typical method of controlling runtime configuration of Docker-based services is through specification of environment variables.  Either set through a startup script reading from https://coreos.com/etcd/docs/latest/[etcd], from https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#env-environment-variables[command-line] settings, or from our https://github.com/gameontext/gameon/blob/master/docker-compose.yml[docker-compose] example, environment variables allow customization of a specific deployment of Game On!

The concierge service utilizes the following environment variables:

* *service_concierge*: The full URL at which the room service can register its rooms (e.g. `https://game-on.org/concierge/registerRoom`). See the https://game-on.org/swagger/[Swagger APIs] for more information about how to register rooms.
* *service_room*: The full URL to register this suite of rooms with concierge (e.g. `wss://game-on.org/rooms`) such that concierge can relay this information to mediator or player service as a player desires.
* *REGISTRATION_SECRET*:
