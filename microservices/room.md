<a href='https://github.com/gameontext/gameon-room'><img src="/images/github.png" width="30px" /></a> Code

The Room service is both an implementation of two Game On! rooms in Java, and a template/starting point for implementing
your own room in Java.  The Room service provides an example of how to register with the concierge and how to provide the
WebSocket implementation that the web application expects.
