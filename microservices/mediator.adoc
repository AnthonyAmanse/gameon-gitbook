The mediator service allows multiplex communication over secure WebSockets between the Game On! Web app and the Game On! Rooms.

== Environment Variables

The typical method of controlling runtime configuration of Docker-based services is through specification of environment variables.  Either set through a startup script reading from https://coreos.com/etcd/docs/latest/[etcd], from https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#env-environment-variables[command-line] settings, or from our https://github.com/gameontext/gameon/blob/master/docker-compose.yml[docker-compose] example, environment variables allow customization of a specific deployment of Game On!

The mediator service utilizes the following environment variables:

* *ETCDCTL_ENDPOINT* (optional): The http-accessible endpoint for an etcd member with configuration for Game On! services. See link:./using_etcd.adoc[using etcd] for more information.
