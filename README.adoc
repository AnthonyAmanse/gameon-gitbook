## About Game On!

Game On! is a text-based throwback adventure that was built by the [wasdev](https://wasdev.net) team to help
illustrate the usage and importance of microservices architecture and how that architecture can be used in a
scalable, production-ready application.

Game On! was built to mimic a chat service with the ability to interact with various objects as well as other
players inside a virtual world, much in the same light as many [MMORPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_role-playing_game)s in the same vein as the
[Hitchhiker's Guide Video Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy_%28video_game%29)
